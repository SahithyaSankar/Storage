<h2 dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">PLACING YOUR ORDER</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">You may place an order for products on the Site (the “Order”) by adding items to </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">‘My Cart’</span><span data-mce-fragment="1"> on the Site and clicking the </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">"Buy now"</span><span data-mce-fragment="1"> button. When you place your “Order”, we will issue you with an “Order Number”. We will do this by email. By placing an Order, you make an offer to us to purchase the products you have selected based on these Terms of Use. Information contained on the Site constitutes an invitation to offer. No information on our website constitutes or should be deemed as an offer by us to supply any products; however, OrgFarm will make every effort to supply the products you have ordered to you. We will notify you that your order is being processed by sending you an “Order Confirmation” via email. However, we do not formally accept your offer until your order has passed our internal validation procedures for verifying the bona fides of each order placed, to prevent credit card or payment malpractices. OrgFarm and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at their sole discretion. We will confirm the acceptance of your order when your order status moves to </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">‘Accepted’</span><span data-mce-fragment="1"> in the </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">My Account / My Orders </span><span data-mce-fragment="1">Section. If we cannot process or accept your Order after payment is received, we will contact you by email or telephone.</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">GST</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Subject to this clause, if Goods and Services Tax (the “GST”) is payable in respect of any supply made to you by OrgFarm, an amount equal to the GST payable (at the current prevailing rate) will be included as part of the price at which the product is sold on the Site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">SUPPLY OF YOUR PRODUCTS</span></h2>

<h2 dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">DELIVERY OF YOUR PRODUCTS</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">As we source products from various locations inter state and intra state, delivery times are subject to variation. We will use our best efforts to ensure your order arrives as soon as possible after the sale is complete. Delivery will be made via many partners and the estimated delivery times will be indicated within each specific sale according to the dispatch location. We use the best possible estimated dates given the information we have been provided by our suppliers and partners; however, many factors are outside of our control and we cannot guarantee delivery within this time frame. Individual order status can be tracked in the My Account/My Orders section. Unless indicated otherwise, we charge shipping and handling for each product you purchase from the Site. You will be informed of the applicable shipping and handling charges before order placement. Due to the nature of our business, we may consolidate orders wherever possible from more than one sale or order. For these orders, shipping and handling charges will remain unaltered. The title of the goods and the risk of loss to all products while transit will pass to you on delivery unless otherwise specified.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">For the avoidance of doubt, If there is any ambiguity relating to the passing of risk and title to the goods will pass to you on the first attempt at delivery, irrespective of whether it was successful or not.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1">Unless outlined in the information page of the product, delivery of bulky goods (for example sacks of rice) assumes ground floor front door delivery.</span></p>
